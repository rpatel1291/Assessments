</p>, <p>Los Angeles created the first municipal <a href=""/wiki/Zoning"" title=""Zoning"">zoning</a> ordinance in the United States. On September 14, 1908, the Los Angeles City Council promulgated residential and industrial land use zones. The new ordinance established three residential zones of a single type, where industrial uses were prohibited. The proscriptions included barns, lumber yards, and any industrial land use employing machine-powered equipment. These laws were enforced against industrial properties after-the-fact. These prohibitions were in addition to existing activities which were already regulated as nuisances. These included explosives warehousing, gas works, oil-drilling, slaughterhouses, and <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Tannery"" title=""Tannery"">tanneries</a>. Los Angeles City Council also designated seven industrial zones within the city. However, between 1908 and 1915, Los Angeles City Council created various exceptions to the broad proscriptions which applied to these three residential zones, and as a consequence, some industrial uses emerged within them. There are two differences from the 1908 Residence District Ordinance and later zoning laws in the United States. First, the 1908 laws did not establish a comprehensive zoning map as the <a href=""/wiki/Zoning_in_the_United_States#Origins_and_history"" title=""Zoning in the United States"">1916 New York City Zoning Ordinance</a> did.

</p>, <p>Dallas, like many other cities, was founded along a river. The city was founded at the location of a ""white rock crossing"" of the Trinity River, where it was easier for wagons to cross the river in the days before ferries or bridges. The Trinity River, though not usefully navigable, is the major waterway through the city. <a href=""/wiki/Interstate_35E_(Texas)"" title=""Interstate 35E (Texas)"">Interstate 35E</a> parallels its path through Dallas along the <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Stemmons_Corridor"" title=""Stemmons Corridor"">Stemmons Corridor</a>, then south alongside the western portion of Downtown and past South Dallas and Pleasant Grove, where the river is paralleled by <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Interstate_45_(Texas)"" title=""Interstate 45 (Texas)"">Interstate 45</a> until it exits the city and heads southeast towards <a href=""/wiki/Houston"" title=""Houston"">Houston</a>.

</p>, <p>Since it was rerouted in the late 1920s, the river has been little more than a drainage ditch within a floodplain for several miles above and below Downtown, with a more normal course further upstream and downstream, but as Dallas began shifting towards postindustrial society, public outcry about the lack of aesthetic and recreational use of the river ultimately gave way to the <a href=""/wiki/Trinity_River_Project"" title=""Trinity River Project"">Trinity River Project</a>,<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-39""><a href=""#cite_note-39"">[39]</a></sup> which was begun in the early 2000s.

</p>, <p>There are four distinct valleys in the city of San Jose: Almaden Valley, situated on the southwest fringe of the city; Evergreen Valley to the southeast, which is hilly all throughout its interior; Santa Clara Valley, which includes the flat, main urban expanse of the South Bay; and the rural <a href=""/wiki/Coyote_Valley,_California"" title=""Coyote Valley, California"">Coyote Valley</a>, to the city's extreme southern fringe.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-Phillips_81-0""><a href=""#cite_note-Phillips-81"">[79]</a></sup>

San Jose has an average of 301 days of sunshine and an annual mean temperature of 60.5 °F (15.8 °C). It lies inland, surrounded on three sides by mountains, and does not front the Pacific Ocean like San Francisco. As a result, the city is somewhat more sheltered from rain, giving it a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Semiarid"" title=""Semiarid"">semiarid</a> feel with a mean annual rainfall of 15.82 inches or 401.8 millimetres, compared to some other parts of the Bay Area, which can receive about three times that amount.
</p>, <p>Like most of the Bay Area, San Jose is made up of dozens of <a href=""/wiki/Microclimate"" title=""Microclimate"">microclimates</a>. Because of a more prominent rain shadow from the Santa Cruz Mountains, Downtown San Jose experiences the lightest rainfall in the city, while South San Jose, only 10 mi (16 km) distant, experiences more rainfall, and somewhat more extreme temperatures.

On average, there are 2.7 mornings annually where the temperature drops to, or below, the freezing mark; and sixteen afternoons where the high reaches or exceeds 90 °F or 32.2 °C. <a href=""/wiki/Diurnal_temperature_variation"" title=""Diurnal temperature variation"">Diurnal temperature variation</a> is far wider than along the coast or in San Francisco but still a shadow of what is seen in the <a href=""/wiki/Central_Valley_(California)"" title=""Central Valley (California)"">Central Valley</a>.
